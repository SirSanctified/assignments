    "description": "I create a number guessing game to generate a number between the range of 1 and 2. The game prompt users for their username. I set range as function parameter and prompt the player to predict the generated number between the given range. At a correct guess, the game awards the player a point and move them to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for stage 2 and so on.",
